# Parallel PageRank Algorithm

This project implements a parallel version of the PageRank algorithm, originally developed by Larry Page, designed to evaluate the relative importance of nodes (e.g., web pages) in a directed graph. The project explores parallel programming techniques to achieve better scalability and efficiency on modern multi-core processors.

 ## Key Features
- Graph Representation: Implemented with adjacency lists for memory efficiency.
- Sequential & Parallel Execution: Baseline sequential implementation + multiple parallel versions.
- Random Graph Generation: Erdős–Rényi model for controlled testing.
- Performance Evaluation: Comparison of sequential vs. parallel execution with speedup measurements.

Optimizations:
- Block-Optimized – improves cache locality.
- Vectorized – uses loop unrolling and SIMD-like optimizations.
- NUMA-Aware – optimized for non-uniform memory access architectures.
- Adaptive Grain Size – balances workload dynamically across threads.
  
## Technologies Used

- C++ – Core implementation.
- Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) – Task-based parallelism (parallel_for, parallel_reduce).
- Erdős–Rényi Model – Random graph generation.
- CSV Export – Benchmark results for performance analysis.

## Algorithm Overview

PageRank is an iterative algorithm defined as:

$$ PR(A) = (1 - d) + d \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{PR(T_i)}{C(T_i)} $$


Iterations continue until convergence (within epsilon threshold).

The parallel implementation leverages independence between node computations per iteration, making it highly suitable for task parallelism.

## Results

Parallel implementation significantly outperforms sequential execution on large graphs.

Performance depends on:
- Graph size and density.
- Number of CPU cores/threads.
- Synchronization overhead.
- Optimizations like block and adaptive grain balancing improve speedup in real-world scenarios.
